Explanation
Account Validation (account.nr)
validate_balance: Ensures that the sender's balance is sufficient to cover the transaction amount. If not, the program will abort.
verify_identity: Verifies the provided account hash against the stored account hash for both the sender and the recipient, ensuring the transaction is being initiated by the correct parties.
Transaction Execution (transaction.nr)
make_transaction:
Verifies the sender's and recipient's identities.
Validates that the sender has enough funds to complete the transaction.
Simulates the update of the recipient’s balance by adding the transaction amount.
Returns the updated balances for both the sender and recipient.
Main Logic (main.nr)
The main function coordinates the transaction.
It calls make_transaction to ensure the transaction is valid and then checks that the sender’s and recipient’s balances have been updated correctly after the transaction.
Proving the Transaction
In the Prover.toml, the values used for the transaction are as follows:

sender_balance = 1000: The sender has 1000 units.
transaction_amount = 200: The transaction amount is 200 units.
recipient_balance = 300: The recipient starts with 300 units.
sender_account_hash = "0xabc123": The hash of the sender’s account.
recipient_account_hash = "0xdef456": The hash of the recipient’s account.
With this setup, the transaction can be executed and verified using zero-knowledge proofs without ever revealing the actual balances or sensitive data of the accounts. The program simply proves that:

The sender has enough balance.
The identities of both parties are verified.
The transaction has been successfully executed, i.e., the sender’s balance is correctly updated, and the recipient’s balance is increased.
