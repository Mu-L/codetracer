# scripts/post-build-setcap.sh — Re-apply BPF capabilities after compilation.
#
# Called by the tup build rule (!codetracer_bpf in Tuprules.tup) after
# compiling the ct binary. Re-applies cap_bpf+cap_perfmon+cap_dac_read_search
# via the codetracer-setcap helper installed by `just developer-setup` or
# the NixOS developer-bpf module.
#
# Silently succeeds if codetracer-setcap is not installed or if passwordless
# sudo is not available — the build still completes successfully.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/post-build-setcap.sh [binary-path]
#
# If binary-path is omitted, targets the default ct binary.

# rule against the resolved path, not the symlink.
