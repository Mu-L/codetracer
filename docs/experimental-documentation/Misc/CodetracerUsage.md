## Inspiration
CodeTracer was largely inspired by the following papers, technologies and pieces of media:

- <https://werat.dev/blog/what-a-good-debugger-can-do>: An excellent survey article, listing most of our competitors.
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72y2EC5fkcE>: A very well-designed IDE for a game engine, featuring a powerful time-travelling debugger.
- <https://www.hytradboi.com/2022/debugging-by-querying-a-database-of-all-program-state>: Presenting [pernosco](https://www.pernos.co/), a novel debugging interface developed by the main authors of RR.
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII>: A classic presentation from Bret Viktor, showcasing the dream of interactive programming.
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpI8hIgOyko>: The original [omniscient debugger](https://omniscientdebugger.github.io/) from Bil Lewis that inspired us to start work on CodeTracer.
- [traceGL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vtKRE9an_I): A little-known JavaScript tracing debugger that has shaped some of the key features of CodeTracer.
