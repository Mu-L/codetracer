## Noir

The initial release of CodeTracer has MVP support for the Noir programming language. It has been developed in collaboration with the Blocksense team and currently requires the use of the [Blocksense Noir Compiler](https://github.com/blocksense-network/noir), which is included in the CodeTracer distribution.

We support many of Noir's features, but not all: e.g. we don't support mutable references currently, we don't serialize struct values and some other cases.

We are planning on adding support for the missing features.
