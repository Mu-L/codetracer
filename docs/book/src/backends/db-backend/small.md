## small lang

small lang is, as the name says, a small, lisp-like language, that's used for general dogfooding of new tracing features and testing of the DB backend.
It's purely experimental.

You can find its source code under `src/small-lang`. There, you can also find multiple files with the `.small`
extension, which can be used as examples of the language.
