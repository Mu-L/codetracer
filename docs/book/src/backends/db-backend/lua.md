## Lua

We still don't have Lua support, however we've had a very minimal proof of concept experiment with supporting Lua (the interpreter, not LuaJIT) with our RR backend years ago.

We can change that patch to produce traces suitable for the DB backend, or at least publish some kind of basis for that(the RR approach remains possible, but with different tradeoffs)
