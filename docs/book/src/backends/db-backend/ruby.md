## Ruby

We currently have partial support for the Ruby programming language in the DB backend. 
We support many cases, you can use it like `ct record <path to rb file> [<args>]` and `ct replay <name of rb file>` (or directly `ct run <path to rb file> [<args>]`)

The recorder for Ruby is currently hosted in the [codetracer-ruby-recorder](https://github.com/metacraft-labs/codetracer-ruby-recorder) repo.

You can read its README for more details. We are welcoming contributors!
