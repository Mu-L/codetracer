## python

We currently have started adding support for recording python programs for the DB backend, but the prototype isn't finished yet. 

The recorder is currently hosted in the [codetracer-python-recorder](https://github.com/metacraft-labs/codetracer-python-recorder) repo.

You can read its README for more details. We are welcoming contributors!
