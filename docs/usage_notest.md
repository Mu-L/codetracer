fix codetracer without args
rust:
  * Jumping to events, fix finding high level location for write
  * Loading values
  * Flow: just before or after for now, lines undetected as visited, loop problems
  * Bug: sometimes stepping twice in the same location
  * View value of expression on hover as well?
  * Call id similar to c `finstrument`-functions?
  * Folder: too many not needed folders
  * ASM: no scrolling, other low level problems
